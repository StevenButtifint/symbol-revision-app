### Description

Revise sets of symbols and images on any topic easily. Created with Python and Tkinter GUI toolkit.

---

### How To Use

- Select an image pack you wish to cover from the dropdown.
- Click the "START" button.
- Images will be introduced to you one at a time and randomly tested.
- Once a full grid of images are displayed you will be tested on the entire grid.
- This process repeats until all images in the pack are covered.

---

### What I Learned

- Dymanic placement and scaling for Tkinter GUI toolkit widgets.
